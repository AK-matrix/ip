# AI Tool Usage and Observations

## Usage Record

| Increment | Tool Used | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Level 2-6 | Google Deepmind's Agentic AI | Generating skeletal code/classes (OOP). |
| A-Collections | Google Deepmind's Agentic AI | Converting `tasks` array to `ArrayList`. |
| A-Enums | Google Deepmind's Agentic AI | Refactoring `AK.java`. |

## Observations

### What Worked?
- **Rapid Prototyping**: The AI generated skeletal code extremely quickly, saving significant boilerplate setup time.
- **Refactoring**: Changing from Arrays to ArrayLists (Level 6) and switching to Enums was handled seamlessly by the AI.

### What Didn't?
- **Hallucinations**: The AI sometimes hallucinates and adds unintended whitespaces or newlines.

### Time Saved
- **Overall**: Estimated time saved is approx. 1.5 hours. The AI handled the repetitive tasks, allowing focus on high-level logic and verification.

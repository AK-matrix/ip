# AI Tool Usage and Observations

## Usage Record

| Increment     | Tool Used | Purpose                                                                                                         |
|:--------------| :--- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 2-6     | Google Deepmind's Agentic AI | Generating skeletal classes and basic boilerplate (OOP, commands, tasks).                                       |
| A-Collections | Google Deepmind's Agentic AI | Converting `tasks` array to `ArrayList` and adjusting related code.                                             |
| A-Enums       | Google Deepmind's Agentic AI | Small refactors in `AK.java` and command parsing to keep up with feature changes.                               |
| Level 10      | Google Deepmind's Agentic AI | Drafting simple CSS and repetitive UI wiring, later refined by hand.                                            |
| D-Contacts    | Google Deepmind's Agentic AI | Was able to duplicate and refactor a lot of previous code since there were behavioural similarities with tasks. |
| Invariants    | Google Deepmind's Agentic AI | Light refactoring in storage and adding a few assertions; overall logic still designed manually.                |

## Observations

### What Worked?
- **Rapid Prototyping**: The AI generated skeletal code extremely quickly, saving significant boilerplate setup time.
- **Refactoring**: Changing from Arrays to ArrayLists, and switching to Enums was handled seamlessly by the AI.

### What Didn't?
- **Hallucinations**: The AI sometimes hallucinates and adds unintended whitespaces or newlines, sometimes attempts altering dependencies.

### Time Saved
- **Overall**: Estimated time saved is approx. 3-4 hours. The AI handled the repetitive tasks, allowing focus on high-level logic and verification.
